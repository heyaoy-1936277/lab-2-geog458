# Topic
For this project, I decided to explore the differences among the Space Needle, Pike Place Market, and the University of Washington campus in Seattle. Since these three sites are the most popular ones in the Seattle Area, I chose to keep a thematic connection to Seattle's urban and educational environment. From the analysis, common elements such as "Seattle," "tourist," and "iconic" prominently featured across the word clouds, underscoring their significance in the city's identity. However, each word cloud also possessed a distinct character, reflecting the unique essence of these landmarks. For instance, the Space Needle's cloud emphasized views and architecture, Pike Place Market's highlighted food and markets, and the UW campus's focused on academia and research. To refine future research, I would consider using more specific terms related to each location to draw a clearer distinction. Visiting these sites provided a foundational understanding, aligning with the anticipated thematic words and affirming their representative roles in Seattle's landscape.
